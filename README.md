# defrag: safe and efficient memory manager for microcontrollers

**This library is in the Beta stage and is subject to change**

This library aims to bring safe heap memory management
to microcontrollers. Combined with rust's excellent type system and
borrow checker, creating complex applications with limited resources
is easier than it has ever been before.
