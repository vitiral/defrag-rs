# defrag: safe and efficient memory manager for microcontrollers

The defrag memory manager aims to bring safe heap memory management
to microcontrollers. Combined with rust's excellent type system and
borrow checker, creating complex applications with limited resources
is easier than it has ever been before.

**This library is in the Alpha release and is subject to change**

See the library documentation at https://docs.rs/defrag/0.1.0/defrag/
